<h2> Theory </h2>

<p>
The goal of a theme in this site is to provide coloring schemes so that a
component designer has some formal guidance on which colors to choose for
different elements of the component, and leave the "arbitrary flare" aspect of
coloring a page to the top level page designer.  It's my opinion that the
arbitrary nature of assigning colors just to be aesthetically pleasing is both
ok, and simply the way it is, but to develop a generic component for others to
use feels less appropriate for adding arbitrary flare without serious
limitations.  </p>

<p>
This article is currently a mind dump for how a system can be approached.  <a
href="https://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7"> This article
</a> has some interesting ideas, where the author introduces a 2-layered
coloring system.  There is a base <em>color palette</em> which is more or less
the <q>world</q> of colors available to choose from when designing a page, such
that the colors look good together.  <b> I like that and it seems like a
necessary first step. </b>  The second layer is a bit more handwavy, at least
that was my impression of the way it was presented, but I think the author is
on to something.  The example given is, when writing a web page, the web
designer asks <q>what color is a button again?</q>. Instead of choosing another
arbitrary color from the color palette, the designer remembers to use
<q>primary action</q> for buttons, which at face value has more meaning than
<q>color-1-500</q>.  However, when looking through css on several pages and other
articles describing semantic colors, I keep coming across terminology like
<q>primary color</q> or <q>secondary color</q>, which even shows up in this
<q>primary action</q> semantic color.  I keep questioning if <q>primary</q> and
<q>secondary</q> is any more <q>semantic</q> than the color palette we started
with, and I don't think it is.  The <q>primary action</q> at least has a hint
of what I think it was trying to get at which helps answer the original example
question. I think the <q>action</q> part of the color name is what starts to get
at actually being semantic to the point of guiding a component designer on which
colors to style the component with.  I still have a few questions.

<ul>
<li> What is an action? Is that too generic?</li>
<li> What makes something primary or not primary?</li>
<li> Is every button a <q>primary action</q>? Does every button need to be the same color?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Another area I started researching is ARIA and accessibility because I often
hear that <q>any information you're conveying with color should be available
to screen readers as well</q>.  I wanted to see what kind of information is
expressed in web pages that apparently is able to convey to screen readers what
colors can convey to sighted users.  One thing I noticed is the difference between
obvious semantic colors that also show up in every example, namely red means errors
or something bad, orange is less severe for warnings, and green means success or 
something good.  It's interesting that these colors have obvious semantic meaning
that don't need any explanation, and I'm assuming the reader agrees with me, yet
for this other holy grail of <q>semantic colors</q>, I'm trying to write an entire
article on what the heck it means and can't entirely figure it out.  I think it's because
colors are mostly used for making things look pretty instead of inherently having any
semantic meaning. I can't think of a time I saw a slight blue hue to a green color and
thought <q>Hey! That reminds me of every primary action on example.com!</q> That doesn't
make any sense and users probably don't think like this, at least not nearly to the extent
of recognizing error/warning/success, closely mirroring the idiom of traffic signals.
</p>

<p>
That last thought sparked a thought. There really is no inherent tie between red and errors.
It's just so ingrained in us with driving, where everyone relates to the universal stop signs
or red lights that mean <q>Stop</q> which translates well to stopping to examine errors.
I suppose the whole point of semantic coloring systems is to add this level of clarity and
consistency to our web pages.  The difference is that, unless you're lucky, driving is far
more ubiquitous and universal than your website probably will be, and the exact meaning of
the color is simply not going to be as recognizable to a user as something like <q> red means
danger </q>.  However, from a site designer perspective, we can still try to be as consistent
within our site as we can for aesthetic and maintainability reasons, or very subtle cues that
users pick up on.  This is because, currently, every site has different color schemes. Users
probably surf the web as <q>the internet</q> instead of focusing on a certain page, so until
every website yields some color-autonomy to an internet theming standard for coloring every
submit button the same, users simply aren't going to recognize things by their colors if the
colors don't actually have any meaningful information. It would be like if every county decided
to color all of their traffic lights and road signs diffenently - drivers wouldn't be able to
navigate by color alone, and they'd need to look for other cues, probably resorting to text
inside the signs and simply reading what they mean, much like surfing the web is today.
</p>

<p> I'm not signing up for convincing everyone to adopt global color schemes on the internet. </p>

<p>
However, I think there's something we can learn from traffic.  Everyone recognizes red as meaning
caution, or stop, or danger.  The example in the article I referenced way earlier was discussing that
there is a color for <q>primary action</q>.  Would that mean there should be a color for a <q>primary road sign</q>.
What the heck does that mean?  Is a stop sign a primary sign? How about a speed limit sign? It simply doesn't make
sense.  Take for example a vim syntax file.  There are default groups for types, identifiers, operators, comments,
preprocessor directives, constants, control statements, etc.  These are all common idioms in either a specific language
or in every language that are very easy to define groups for.  The color doesn't necessarily mean anything, but there's
at least recognizable consistency when every preprocessor macro or every string / constant looks the same color. I think
this is the semantic we're going for.  Much like red is used for <b>stop</b> (not primary) signs, we want to define
these patterns in our web pages to color.  That begs the question: <b>are there cross-site patterns or are the patterns
site specific?</b>.  The good news is that web developers learn from each other and move from company to company thus
cross-polinating patterns, so most websites at face value seem the same.  For example, how mahy wordpress sites exist?
There are probably some patterns we can tease out.  Let's give it a try.
</p>

<p>
Not every web page serves the same purpose.  Different categories that I can think of:
<ul>
<li> articles </li>
<li> forms </li>
<li> a ton of apps i can think of that don't fall into an easy to define category </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It's probably not productive to try and make a global standard that one-size-fits all every web page.  It's likely
application specific.  For example, there are so many video sharing sites that are basically the same.  A video
sharing application could define different idioms that then a theme designer could match-make the color palette to
and the theme will make the video sharing app look pretty.  That seems more doable.
</p>

<p>
I need to get back to the problem I'm trying to solve.  Here are the questions I'm trying to answer:
<ul>
<li> How does a cross-application generic component color itself to be <q>themable</q>? (buttons/tabs/etc) </li>
<li> How does a cross-site generic web application color itself to be themeable? (wordpress/mediawiki/etc) </li>
<li> How does a site that deploys applications map theme colors to plug into the apps that are deployed? </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Truly generic components have no idea what they're being used for and carry little semantic value on their own. A
submit button seems very different than a cancel button or a button that is programmed to blow something up. It
seems like too much to ask for a component designer to know what semantic information to program for, and the
component should instead simply make sure that it looks fine without any styling next to standard web controls
using their default styling, and it should also allow for being colored by something that wants to assign more meaning.
</p>

<p>
Applications will consist of different web pages which are composed of different components.  The pages should know
which semantic information they are conveying to the user and can style the components accordingly.  If similar
groups of applications want to federate and form standards that they can all program against for more generic theming,
that seems fine, but doesn't seem like a requirement and is not currently the state of the industry so cannot be
an expectation. The app should take as configuration parameters the different semantic colors that it exposes. This
way the site maintainer of each site that deploys the application can map the color palette to each semantic color
for each application deployed on the site.
